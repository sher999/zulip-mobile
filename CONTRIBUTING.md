## Previous information

The details below are from when this app was in active development.
Some details may still be useful, but bear in mind that this
app is in maintenance mode as described above.

* **Start** by reading our [developer guide](docs/developer-guide.md).

* **Review** [open issues][open-issues] and submit a pull request.

* **Issues**. Before working on an issue make sure to claim it.  To do
  so, leave a comment on the GitHub issue thread like "I'm working on
  this issue and would like to claim it."  Conversely, if someone else
  is working on an issue then try looking for a different issue to
  work on instead.

* **Code and commit style**.  The Zulip project maintains high
  standards for clear communication in our code and our Git commits.
  See the Zulip guide to [clear and coherent commits][commit-style],
  and the Zulip Mobile [style guide][style-guide].
