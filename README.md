Zulip Mobile is the official mobile Zulip client, supporting both iOS
and Android.


## Get the app

Release versions of the app are available here:
* [Zulip for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/zulip/id1203036395)
  on the iTunes App Store
* [Zulip for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zulipmobile)
  on the Google Play Store
  * Or if you don't use Google Play, you can [download an
    APK](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/releases/latest)
    from the official build we post on GitHub, or get the app
    [on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.zulipmobile/).

You can also help out by [running beta versions](#using-the-beta) of
the app, and reporting bugs!


## Maintenance mode

This codebase built on React Native is a **legacy app, which is in
maintenance mode** as we [focus on building][zulip-flutter-beta]
a [new Zulip mobile app with Flutter][zulip-flutter].
This means:

 * This repository is the source code of the app we're still
   distributing and recommending for most users, until the new app is
   fully built and ready to replace it.

 * Feedback is still welcome.  Some bugs and feature requests will be
   naturally resolved by the new app; others won't, and we'll transfer
   them over when the time comes as issues on the new app.  We're
   happy to do the work of identifying which is which â€” it's usually
   easy for us, given the time we've spent in both codebases.

 * The development work we do in this repo is kept to a minimum: we
   fix critical bugs, and we add support for a few of the new features
   being added to Zulip on the web and desktop, those where the
   leverage from mobile support is highest.

 * We aren't able to spend significant time investigating other bugs,
   or reviewing PRs from contributors.  We're investing that time
   instead in getting the new Flutter app finished and into all our
   users' hands as soon as possible.

Details below are from when this app was in active development.
Some details may still be useful, but **bear in mind that this
app is in maintenance mode** as described above.

### Using the beta

One important way to contribute is to run beta versions of the app, and report
bugs!  To get the beta:

* Android: install the app, then just
  [join the testing program](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.zulipmobile/)
  on Google Play.
  * Or if you don't use Google Play, you can [download an
    APK](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/releases/); the latest
    release on GitHub (including "pre-releases") is the current beta.
* iOS: install [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/testers/),
  then open [this public invitation link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/ZuzqwXGf)
  on your device.

Bug reports are welcome either in [the #mobile stream](#discussion) or
on this GitHub repo.


### Development

Zulip Mobile is written in JavaScript with React Native.  To get
started with the code, follow this doc:

* [Developer Guide](docs/developer-guide.md)

Then see our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md), and come say
hello in [the #mobile-dev-help stream](#discussion).

For more reading, take a look at our [developer docs](docs/).


### History
